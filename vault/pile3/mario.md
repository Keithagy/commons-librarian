general profile of mario yanez
I care deeply about what makes us fully human, what that really means, the potential of what that could mean. I believe it has something to do with how we relate to each other and the web of Life. Currently our mode of being human is toxic for our ecosystems and the planet.
My path began the day my daughter was born (24 years ago). To date it has been marked with many social experiments, prototypes, off-the-wall interventions, alternate ways that we might show up as human, ways that amplify the Life-sustaining capacity of our biosphere.

Through my whole-systems design practice, I've gained much lived experience. This next phase, I feel called to deepen my understanding about this Universe-of-Complexity from which I continue learning so much, identify the patterns that ought to continue (and those that ought not),and share, share, share.

As I get older, I am becoming clearer and clearer on which games I want to play, and which I have absolutely no interest in participating.

Motivation: I am in RKC because I believe we all must work in nodal ways—to be strategic on how we use our energies—to accelerate and amplify transformative change particularly in human social systems, which are clearly misaligned with natural living systems. As a founding steward of the Regenerative Knowledge Commons, I believe it is essential that our collective efforts become visible and tangible to each other and to the “outside” world. My participation here is bringing forth a new possibility: to actualize the potential of regenerative commoning.

More about my practice: My practice involves enabling the various allied change-maker movements to work more transformatively.
My Idea of regenerative: I consider regenerative a state of being, one that must be continually regenerated. It requires rigorous conscious practice on my part to elevate my thinking and pay attention to level of energy I am working from. It also means that I remain conscious that I am always working simultaneously to develop capacity in myself, the field (others I work with), and the systems I seek to transform.
